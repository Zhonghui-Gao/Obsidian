## Abstract
> [!abstract]
> With ever more complex functionalities being implemented in emerging real-time applications, multiprocessor systems are demanded for high performance, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used to model functional dependencies. In this work, we study a single periodic non-preemptive DAG running on a homogeneous multiprocessor platform, which is a common setup in many domains, such as automotive, robotics, and industrial automation. Aiming to reduce the makespan of the DAG and provide a tight yet safe bound, our contributions involve the exploitation of node-level parallelism and inter-node dependency, which are the two key factors of a DAG topology. First, we introduce a concurrent provider and consumer (CPC) model that precisely captures the above two factors, and can be recursively applied when parsing a DAG. Building upon CPC, we propose a novel scheduling method focused on reducing the makespan that orders the nodes in the following sequence: (i) the critical path, (ii) early predecessor paths of the critical path, and (iii) longer paths. Secondly, new response time analysis is presented, which provides a generic bound for any execution order of the non-critical nodes and a speciﬁc (tighter) bound for a ﬁxed such order. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our scheduling approach and analysis outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods.
