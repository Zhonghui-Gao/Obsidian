## Abstract
> [!abstract]
> Model-driven methodology has been widely adopted in embedded software design, and Dataﬂow is a widely used computation model, with strong modeling and simulation ability supported in tools such as Ptolemy. However, its code synthesis support is quite limited, which restricts its applications in real industrial practice. In this paper, we focus on the automatic code synthesis of Dataﬂow, and implement DFSynth, a code generator that could support most of the widely used modeling features such as expression type and boolean switch, more efﬁciently. First, we disassemble the Dataﬂow model into actors embedded in if-else or switch-case statements based on schedule analysis, which bridges the semantic gap between the code and the original Dataﬂow model. Then, we design well-designed templates for each actor, and synthesize well-structured executable C and Java codes with sequential code assembly. Compared to the existing C and Java code generators of Dataﬂow model in Ptolemy-II, and the C code generator in Simulink, the lines of code synthesized by DFSynth are decreased by an average of 99.7%, 81.4% and 61.9%, and the execution time of the synthesized code by DFSynth is also decreased by an average of 76.2%, 56.8% and 22.7% respectively.
