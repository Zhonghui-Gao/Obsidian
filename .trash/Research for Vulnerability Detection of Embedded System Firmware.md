## Abstract
> [!abstract]
> Because the embedded devices are widely used in the life, the industry, the national defense, the security of embedded system becomes especially important. The embedded systems firmware with the characteristics of strong concealment, difficulties of detecting, long maintenance cycle, the big hazard, has big threat to society security, industry security, national security. The paper summarizes the characteristics, current situation of vulnerability of embedded system firmware, and introduces the vulnerability detection briefly.
